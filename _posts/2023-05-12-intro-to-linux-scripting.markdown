title:  "Introduction to Linux Scripting - bash"
---

Hey there everyone. I know it has been a long time since I posted anything to my website. Regardless, I want to share with you today a resource that me and other students collaborated on pertaining to writing scripts using `bash`. This handy online guide was developed for a technical writing class to assist users with some Linux experience how to get started with writing their first script, automating workstation common tasks, manipulating/parsing text. Each topic is separated into modules to allow for easy organization. I expect that in the future this site could be updated to contain more topics.
