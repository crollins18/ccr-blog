title:  "CSC Independent Development - Cybersecurity Education Portals"
---

## Overview
In my first semester of undergrad at NCSU, I voluntarily enrolled in a course called [_CSC Independent Development_](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/academics/undergrad/research.php). The course pairs up students with faculty within the department of computer science to contribute to their research projects. Students hear pitches from available professors and submit their project preferences accordingly. With a strong interest in cybersecurity, a project facilitated by [Dr. Laurie Williams](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/people/lawilli3) really caught my eye. This project tasked students (including myself) with the implementation of two web portals with the aim of educating the public about ways to protect themselves online. Often times, those outside the world of cybersecurity simply fail to take adequate steps to increase their security posture because of the time and technical intuition that a task might entail. To combat this hurdle, the project aimed to create a web-based hub for anyone, regardless of familiarity with technology, to get resources on cyber-hygiene (crafting a strong password, using a VPN, spotting phishing, etc.) and ways to reduce cyber-stalking. Most of my contributions came from researching and writing the informational content in the form of articles, presentations, and short animated videos to be published on the pages. 

Throughout the project I had lots of interaction with Git to maintain site version control, Jekyll site engine to create our websites in a templated and dynamic way, and GitHub Pages to publish our prototype sites for authenticated NCSU users. During this semester, I also stepped into the responsibility of the student group representative. This meant that I would meet with our advising professor weekly to ask questions on behalf of the other students, give work status reports, and ensure the future work completed was unified with the mission and vision of the project.

> Looking back, my biggest takeaway was learning how to concisely and clearly communicate often very technical topics in a manner that everyday digital citizens could understand. The entire process of taking online research and pairing it down to the essentials helped hone my overall understanding of topics I only had a general understanding about before. Finally, this project strengthened my abilities to work collaboratively in a professional setting that had firm deadlines.
