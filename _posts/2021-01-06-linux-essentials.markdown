title:  "Linux Command Line Essentials Presentation"
---

Recently the members of the [Linux Usersâ€™ Group at NC State](https://lug.ncsu.edu/) (including myself) created presentations about various Linux topics for use by [High Performance Computing at NC State](https://projects.ncsu.edu/hpc/main.php) when on-boarding new users. I chose to focus on the basics of the command line.
