title:  "CSC Senior Project - Laboratory for Analytic Sciences"
---

Every semester the [CSC Senior Design Center at NCSU](https://sdc.csc.ncsu.edu/about/the-center), tasks student teams with developing a software solution for industry partners. I recently had the pleasure of collaborating with four other students to solidify one component of a ML Model Deployment Service. Our project was in direct support of the [Laboratory for Analytic Sciences at NCSU](https://ncsu-las.org/about/). LAS represents a formal partnership between U.S. Department of Defense intelligence agencies and researchers at NCSU. LAS desired a simpler system to allow data scientists to deploy [ML models](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/machine-learning-models) without requiring all personnel to have the technical expertise necessary. Our final product leveraged predefined workflow templates that acted as barebones blueprints for what an instantiated deployment would need. This allows system administrators to upload templates and our application would handle filling out the concrete details like the compute cluster, container/image to run, resources, timeouts, and time-to-live.

As with any software project, the key phases of the development lifecycle were practiced including requirements elicitation, design planning, implementation, product testing, and delivery. All artifacts from these phases were rigorously reviewed by faculty advisors and our sponsors at LAS. Each week the team conducted status meetings with LAS personnel to get clarification and resolve any other blockers to progress. A significant portion of this project involved evaluating the effectiveness of a workflow scheduling technology called [Argo Workflows](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#what-is-argo-workflows) that had some of the templating features we desired right out of the box. Research was conducted with how to point Argo to a Kubernetes compute cluster, how to use the provided Python SDK for integration with our application, and how recognize resources like GPUs to be used for the ML Model.

> The team implemented, demonstrated, and evaluated the applicability of using the open source orchestration technology Argo Workflows to automate Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) tasks in a Kubernetes cluster. Data scientists are training more operational ML models than ever before, and the challenge of effectively utilizing these powerful models is quickly becoming one of management and orchestration engineering rather than model development. The core intent of this project is to enable automation and scaling in this space, reducing the burden on engineers and data science practitioners. The student team effectively demonstrated that Argo is a powerful tool to help achieve this end goal. <br><br>

The semester culminated at the [Posters and Pies symposium](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/news/2565). Here the team presented our findings and accomplishments to other students, faculty, and industry sponsors. Live demos of our working product really sparked the interest of many of the guests to learn more about the project. The team also presented at the [LAS Annual Research Symposium](https://ncsu-las.org/2023/12/intelligence-community-prototypes-research-symposium/) to other government organizations and civilian contractors. Although I had prior experience presenting to classmates and co-workers with technical background, this experience was unique in that I had to extemporaneously tailor my conversations to accommodate visitors with varying understandings in technology. My technical communication skills were challenged (in a good way) I would say.

>This summary just the tip of the iceberg. If you are interested in learning more about the project, I highly encourage you read the accompanying article published by LAS on the entire scope of the model deployment service (outside what our team worked on) <br> [https://ncsu-las.org/2023/12/an-introduction-to-the-las-model-deployment-service](https://ncsu-las.org/2023/12/an-introduction-to-the-las-model-deployment-service/)
