Hello world! It is me. Now I am not one for long descriptive posts, but just for today, I will make an exception.

Today, I am proud to announce that #IChoseNCState. I look forward to studying Computer Science at NC State’s College of Engineering. NC State’s philosophy is “Think and Do”, a phase that simplistically conveys the desire of the university to inspire, motivate, and prepare students to face the world’s toughest problems head-on. I can’t wait to join this community that has such a strong mission.

To all seniors, I know that with the developments related to COVID-19 are rightfully discouraging, but I would encourage you to use this time to grow closer with your family before your next steps and ultimately slow down the often fast routine of normal life. This virus while marking a historic time, will NOT define us forever. We as a country will overcome this hurdle and will reemerge a stronger united nation because of our experiences. Although tough to accept, often the most important lessons and wisdom we gain in life are when everything comes to a grinding halt.

Finally, in the words of the famous author Stephen King, “Don’t let the sun go down without saying thank you to someone, and without admitting to yourself that absolutely no one gets this far alone.” I would be remiss to not acknowledge the gratitude I have for my parents. Since the beginning, you both have always there to support me in my trials and successes. You have always believed in me and have motivated me throughout my academic career. This huge milestone is just as much a reflection of myself as it is both of you.
